!!this describes the code. Data can be found here as data files: http://dx.doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/S28QB and here through an interactive map: https://jhnienhuis.users.earthengine.app/view/globaldelta !!

This readme explains how to generate a global delta dataset including relevant river/wave/tidal parameters that can be used to predict delta morphology.

Required datasets:

- HydroSheds 15 arcsec drainage direction (DIR), flow accumulation (ACC), and basin outline (BAS) files
source: https://www.hydrosheds.org/

- DIVA typology_coastline
source: AT Vafeidis, G Boot, J Cox, R Maatens, L McFadden, RJ Nicholls, T Spencer, RSJ Tol, (2006) The DIVA database documentation, DINAS-COAST Consortium

- DURR dataset

- NOAA vectorized shoreline

- WBMSed global discharge, pristine, and disturbed sediment fluxes

- Global directional wave statistics (WaveWatch), and global tides (TOPEX)

- SRTM, 1 arcsec (30 meter) resolution global topography

(1) run find_river_mouth.m
    uses hydrosheds, DIVA, Durr, and SRTM to find all alluvial river mouths globally. returns a .mat file per continent

(2) run get_QRiver.m
    uses WBMSED to get a pristine and disturbed sediment and water flux to each delta. adds fluxes to each .mat file

(3) run get_channel_slope.m
    uses SRTM and hydrosheds to extract river elevation profiles for all rivers, extracts delta slopes

(4) run combine_continent_files.m
    merges all continent files into one .mat file

(5) run get_Qwave
    adds wave data to each delta

(6) run get_Qtide
    adds tide data to each delta

(7a) run get_aquamonitor_data
    returns a shoreline that belongs to each delta

(7b) run https://code.earthengine.google.com/451465dc579747ae0b39b5f2f8ad1b12
    retrieves land loss and land gain that belongs to each delta

(7c) run get_aquamonitor_data
    puts aquamonitor data back into the script

(8) run create_netcdf
    creates a netcdf from the .mat file
