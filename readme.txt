This readme explains how to generate a global delta dataset including relevant river/wave/tidal parameters that can be used to predict delta morphology.
It also contains a lot of other useful functions to retrieve delta morphology, recent delta area change, and other delta attributes.

Input datasets:

- HydroSheds 15 arcsec drainage direction (DIR), flow accumulation (ACC), and basin outline (BAS) files

- DIVA typology_coastline

MAIN FUNCTIONS:
(1) find_river_mouth.m
    uses hydrosheds, DIVA, Durr, and SRTM to find all alluvial river mouths globally, furtheron referred to as deltas. Starts the GlobalDeltaData.mat file

(2) get_QRiver.m
    uses WBMSED to get a pristine and disturbed sediment and water flux to each delta. Optionally you can use get_QRiver_timeseries to get daily QRiver and Discharge output

(3) get_channel_slope.m
    uses SRTM and hydrosheds to extract river elevation profiles for all deltas up to 30 meters elevation
    
(4) get_bathy_profile.m
    uses etopo data to get steepest descent profiles of the underwater basin depths, from the river mouth to -100m
    
(5) get_Qwave
    adds wave data to each delta from WaveWatch. For deltas that are (partially) sheltered from wave approach angles, it estimates a fetch based on shoreline orientation.
    It uses the bretschneider fetch formula and WaveWatch wind data to estimate wave heights in sheltered locations. Uses get_global_fetch.m. 
    Optionally you can use get_QWave_timeseries to get daily wave statistics

(6) get_Qtide
    adds tide data to each delta, based on TOPEX data
    
(7) get_hydrobasins_id
    adds identifiers from the new WWF HydroATLAS, HydroBasins, and HydroRIVERS datasets

(8) 

(7) get_aquamonitor_data
    returns a shoreline that belongs to each delta

(7b) run https://code.earthengine.google.com/451465dc579747ae0b39b5f2f8ad1b12
    retrieves land loss and land gain that belongs to each delta

(7c) run get_aquamonitor_data
    puts aquamonitor data back into the script

(8) run create_netcdf
    creates a netcdf from the .mat file
